d3 folder holds visualization files (code, source, html for localhost viewing).

Initially I attempted to use dimplejs library to satisfy project requirements.
I downloaded all that I was instructed and it downgraded python to 2.7 version,
but also messed up ability to connect to the SQLalchemy, run Flask, or node commands.
The issue was not fixed until Dec 3rd with Matt W help(which was too late to 
reprocess all the plots for the presetnation). I attempted to resolve the issue
with Matt's assistance remotely during last week of Nov, but unseccessfuly.  
As a result, all plots are sourced from csv files with Matt's approval.

Run localhost command on d3 folder (py -m http.server) and you will see the list of the active links
to the available plots. Please note that not all plots were used in the dashboard.
I left other plots in, as a showcase of the work done.

Folders and their contents - 
- d3Plots - holds all code files
- Data - holds all the supporting csv's.
- images - holds screenshots of the executed plots.
